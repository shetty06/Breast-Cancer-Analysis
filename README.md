Breast Cancer Analysis

Reading the dataset:

Displaying the dataset:

Problem statement :

BreastÂ cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. The tumor is malignant (cancer) if the cells can grow into surrounding tissues or spread to distant areas of the body.

The main aim of our project is to analyse the breast cancer data so as to provide preventive measures that can be taken by patients before the condition becomes too serious.
We also wish to analyse at which stage is the cancer by analysing the causing factors.

For the analysis we will use KNN (K nearest neighbour) method.
We use this method, as it is most preferred for classification for analysis for breast cancer and gives maximum accuracy.

QUESTIONS:

1. How are the various measurements related?

2. Are there statistically significant differences between Benign and Malignant patients for the mean values of the variables?

3. Do the Benign and Malignant show similar amounts of variation for the variables?
